- [x] Get the adjacency matrix to DistMul
- [x] Pipeline the two experiments somehow
- [x] Test training loop for classification task
- [x] Test training loop for link prediction
- [x] Complete the evaluation scripts to save checkpoints and best model
- [x] Evaluation scripts
- [x] Revamp GCN into configurable layers
- [x] Refactor into Encoder and Decoder hierarchical structure with Aggregator

Requirements: rdflib, wget, scipy, sklearn
