# r-gcn
PyToch implementation of R-GCN model for node classification and link prediction

- [x] Code skeleton
- [x] Get link_data to DistMul properly
- [x] Get the adjacency matrix to DistMul
- [x] Pipeline the two experiments somehow
- [x] Test training loop for classification task
- [x] Test training loop for link prediction
- [x] Complete the evaluation scripts to save checkpoints and best model
- [ ] Evaluation scripts
- [ ] Revamp GCN into configurable layers
- [ ] Refactor into Encoder and Decoder hierarchical structure with Aggregator and possible sampling

Requirements: rdflib, wget, scipy, sklearn
