# r-gcn
PyToch implementation of R-GCN model for node classification and link prediction

- [x] Code skeleton
- [ ] Logger in prepare_dataset.py
- [ ] Get link_data to DistMul properly
- [ ] Get the adjacency matrix to DistMul
- [ ] Pipeline the two experiments somehow
- [ ] Test training loop for classification task
- [ ] Test training loop for link prediction
- [ ] Complete the evaluation scripts to save checkpoints and best model
