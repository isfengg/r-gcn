# r-gcn
PyToch implementation of R-GCN model for node classification and link prediction

- [x] Code skeleton
- [ ] Logger in prepare_dataset.py
- [x] Get link_data to DistMul properly
- [x] Get the adjacency matrix to DistMul
- [x] Pipeline the two experiments somehow
- [x] Test training loop for classification task
- [x] Test training loop for link prediction
- [x] Complete the evaluation scripts to save checkpoints and best model

- [ ] Tune performance of both models
- [ ] Clean up

Requirements: rdflib, wget, scipy, sklearn
