# r-gcn
PyToch implementation of R-GCN model for link prediction

## Obvious improvements
- Multiple neegative sampling
- Normalize embeddings
- L2 regularization on relation embeddings
- Use Adagrad and hyperparametter tuning
- Filter the rankings (efficiently!)

Requirements: rdflib, wget, scipy, sklearn
